## Actual technical limitations

The complete HTML/JavaScript bundle runs on the player's device. Its bytes can be extracted by anyone with developer tools. Obfuscation, domain locks, and client-side "license verification" are not strong copy protection, and can break offline or APK support.

## V107 hardening

- Only the authoritative host may approve rewards, market purchases, timed selection ownership, rejoin identity, and kicking players.
- Clients have durable locally held 192-bit random identities. They are not present in invitation links, only the room code is shared.
- Repeated input flooding and unauthenticated game command packets are filtered on the host connection.
- Disconnected lobby seats are held for up to 60 seconds, and reconnecting players reuse their existing slot.
- Marketplace and reward selections expire automatically to prevent any one player from stalling the match.
- Saved friends, friend IDs and progress remain local or in user-controlled cloud sync. Clearing browser storage without synchronized account recovery can erase them.

## Stronger protection for a commercial release

Secure payment entitlements and scarce currencies in a server-controlled, authenticated database; verify purchases through a payment provider's server-to-server event and issue short-lived signed sessions. Protect the relay with verified account identity, origin allowlists, IP/device rate limits, message size limits and abuse monitoring. Move competitive leaderboard score validation and value-bearing game logic away from the player's browser. Avoid embedding secrets in public JavaScript.

These are defensive design notes. They are not a claim that HTML source cannot be copied.

## V108 copyright and collision fixes

- Official canonical site, copyright in the home screen, OpenGraph ownership metadata and a no-redistribution notice deter uncredited distribution. These are not unbreakable technical copy protection.
- Host rejects guest profile updates beyond 18,000 JSON characters; existing packet limits and authoritative award logic remain intact.
- Exclusive game-selection dialog rendering and automatic hiding of competing HUD elements prevent overlapping popups on mobile.
- WARNING: The source GitHub repo is public; a private development repository would keep unreleased code out of search results. Every deployed HTML/JS build is still extractable, even if obfuscated. Paid entitlements need server-side verification.
